**Hello,**

This repo is meant to hold some coding that is done inside python for various independent work.
The main purpose of this is to show case some simple work that was done using various libraries and packages
to develope skills and a familiarity with these tools. Techniques used vary but ultimately serve the goal to learn new skills and packages.

Any code posted is meant to show off skills from these programs and scripts! Anyone wanting to use and change the code is free to do so!
